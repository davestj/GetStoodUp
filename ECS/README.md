# # GetStoodUp: CloudFormation Template ECS Setup

This CloudFormation template sets up an Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster with associated resources. It allows you to create an ECS cluster and associate it with an existing Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository. The template includes parameters for customizing the cluster name and ECR repository.

## Parameters

The following parameters can be customized during stack creation:

- **ClusterName**: Name of the ECS cluster.
- **ECRRepository**: Name of the existing ECR repository to associate with the ECS cluster.

## Resources

The CloudFormation template creates the following resources:

- **ECSCluster**: An ECS cluster with the specified name.
- **ECSTaskExecutionRole**: An IAM role for ECS task execution. It allows ECS tasks to perform necessary actions.
- **ECSServiceRole**: An IAM role for the ECS service. It grants permissions to manage the ECS cluster and associated resources.
- **ECSCapacityProvider**: An ECS capacity provider with auto-scaling configuration. It ensures the cluster can scale based on resource requirements.
- **ECRAssociation**: Associates the ECS cluster with an existing ECR repository.

## Outputs

The CloudFormation stack provides the following outputs:

- **ECSClusterArn**: ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the ECS cluster.
- **ECSClusterName**: Name of the ECS cluster.

## Usage

1. Deploy the CloudFormation stack using the provided template.
2. Provide values for the **ClusterName** and **ECRRepository** parameters.
3. Wait for the stack creation to complete successfully.

## Connecting to the ECS Cluster

To interact with the ECS cluster, perform the following steps:

1. Retrieve the ECS cluster ARN from the CloudFormation stack output: **ECSClusterArn**.
2. Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to connect to the ECS cluster by specifying the ARN.

## Securing ECS with IAM Role Policies

The CloudFormation template automatically creates the necessary IAM roles for ECS task execution and service management. However, it is essential to review and customize the IAM role policies based on your security requirements.

1. **ECSTaskExecutionRole**: This IAM role is used by ECS tasks to perform actions such as accessing ECR repositories, writing logs to CloudWatch, and retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. Modify the role's permissions to match your application's specific requirements.

2. **ECSServiceRole**: The IAM role grants the ECS service permissions to manage the ECS cluster, services, and tasks. It is crucial to review and adjust the policy based on your application's needs.

Ensure that IAM role policies are properly configured to grant the least privileges required for your ECS cluster's operation.

For detailed information on IAM roles and policies, refer to the [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

Remember to regularly review and update IAM policies to adhere to your application's security standards.

**Note:** It is recommended to follow AWS Security Best Practices and implement additional security measures, such as VPC configurations, network access controls, and encryption, to enhance the security of your ECS environment.
